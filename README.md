- 👋 Hi, I’m @samih-adam
- 👀 I’m interested in Python...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python fundementals ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects...



just practicing this three hour code course from freecodecamp

My goal for this project is to complete the beginner and intermediate course in full, have all the notes and all the code that I tested here so that I can come back 
and if I need any help its listed for me step by step. 

I would love to become a developer and develop my own web apps and projects, and usually I do the course half way and give up. 

Listing all my notes and than pushing them to git hub will force me to keep on track and be more consistent with my self taught coding journy. 

I want to get to the point where I can understand mutliple coding languages and than use those to build future programs for myself and hopefully clients!
