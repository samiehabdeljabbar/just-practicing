#in this lesson we will be learning how to build a basic calculator

num1 = input("Enter a number: ")
num2 = input("Enter another number: ")
result = float(num1) + float(num2)

print(result)

# so not quite the answer we were looking for lol
#you can use the int function to turn the num variable into an interger!
#int function is flawed though because it only looks for whole numbers
#you can than use the float function to parlay that. Float can do whole numbers or decimals(floats)
