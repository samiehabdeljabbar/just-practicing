#What we are going to do is practice variables!
#Why manually change each line, rather we can use variables to change multiple lines of data at once
#Imagine doing that thousands of time in ten's of thousands of code

#these are strings that I am storing value in. a string is where you store plain text
#another store of value I can use is numbers
#another data that I can store is boolean values, which are true or false statements


is_male = False
character_name = "John"
#Example of a number valuable below
character_age = 50


print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ",")
print("He was " + character_age + " years old.")

character_name = "Mike"

print("He Really liked the name " + character_name + ",")
print("but didnt like being " + character_age+".")
